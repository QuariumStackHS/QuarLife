   * There are many functions for executing (or "performing") a command (or

   * and you always do it from a transaction class.
   *
   * Command execution can throw many types of exception, including sql_error,
   * broken_connection, and many sql_error subtypes such as
   * feature_not_supported or insufficient_privilege.  But any exception thrown
   * by the C++ standard library may also occur here.  All exceptions you will
   * see libpqxx are derived from std::exception.
   *
   * One unusual feature in libpqxx is that you can give your query a name or
   * description.  This does not mean anything to the database, but sometimes
   * it can help libpqxx produce more helpful error messages, making problems
   * in your code easier to debug.

   * Use this with a range-based "for" loop.  It executes the query, and
   * directly maps the resulting rows onto a @c std::tuple of the types you
   * specify.  It starts before all the data from the server is in, so if your
   * network connection to the server breaks while you're iterating, you'll get
   * an exception partway through.
   *
   * The tuple may contain @c std::string_view fields, but the strings to which
   * they point will only remain valid until you extract the next row.  After
   * that, the memory holding the string may be overwritten or deallocated.
   *
   * If any of the columns can be null, and the C++ type to which it translates
   * does not have a null value, wrap the type in @c std::optional (or if
   * you prefer, @c std::shared_ptr or @c std::unique_ptr).  These templates
   * do recognise null values, and libpqxx will know how to convert to them.
   *
   * The connection is in a special state until the iteration finishes.  So if
   * it does not finish due to a @c break or a @c return or an exception, then
   * the entire connection becomes effectively unusable.
   *
   * Querying in this way is faster than the @c exec() methods for larger
   * results (but probably slower for small ones).  Also, you can start
   * processing rows before the full result is in.  Also, @c stream() scales
   * better in terms of memory usage.  Where @c exec() reads the entire result
   * into memory at once, @c stream() will read and process one row at at a
   * time.
   *
   * Your query executes as part of a COPY command, not as a stand-alone query,
   * so there are limitations to what you can do in the query.  It can be
   * either a SELECT or VALUES query; or an INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE with a
   * RETURNING clause.  See the documentation for PostgreSQL's COPY command for
   * the details:
   *
   *     https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-copy.html
   *
   * Iterating in this way does require each of the field types you pass to be
   * default-constructible, copy-constructible, and assignable.  These
   * requirements may be loosened once libpqxx moves on to C++20.

   * @name Parameterized statements
   *

   * car with this licence plate."  If the parameter is a string, you need to
   * quote it and escape any special characters inside it, or it may become a
   * target for an SQL injection attack.  If it's an integer (for example),

   * Parameterised statements are an easier and safer way to do this.  They're
   * like prepared statements, but for a single use.  You don't need to name
   * them, and you don't need to prepare them first.
   *
   * Your query will include placeholders like @c $1 and $2 etc. in the places
   * where you want the arguments to go.  Then, you pass the argument values
   * and the actual query is constructed for you.
   *
   * Pass the exact right number of parameters, and in the right order.  The
   * parameters in the query don't have to be neatly ordered from @c $1 to
   * @c $2 to @c $3 - but you must pass the argument for @c $1 first, the one
   * for @c $2 second, etc.
   *
   * @warning Beware of "nul" bytes.  Any string you pass as a parameter will
   * end at the first char with value zero.  If you pass a string that contains
   * a zero byte, the last byte in the value will be the one just before the
   * zero.
